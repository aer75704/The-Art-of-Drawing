<title> The Art of Drawing

<h1> Drawing is one of the many hobbies that I have enjoyed all my life. My artistic talent came from both my parents. My mother is artistically gifted, and my father is musically gifted. I have been drawing since I was a baby, but I never took it seriously until I was a junior in highschool and i finally took a legitimate art class.
